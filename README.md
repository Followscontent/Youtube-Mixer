# Youtube Mixer

## About
This is a very rough draft for a Youtube crossfader.
The draft has been tested under OS X Yosemite & Sierra, with Google Chrome & Safari.
No guarantee. This is messy code.

## Controls

And tons of examples from stackoverflow about the Youtube 3 API.


Have a nice day!<br>
